## Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

My name is **Adam**, and I'm a passionate and hardworking **3rd-year Computer Science** student at the **National College of Ireland**. I have a deep love for technology and coding, and I'm constantly pushing myself to learn and grow in this ever-evolving field.

### Languages I Can Use Well

### My Goal
My current goal is to become a **front-end web developer**. (Since this is what interests me as of currently)

Although in the future becoming a **full stack** or **back-end engineer** seems cool too.
